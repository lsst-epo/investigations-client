// Utility
// Utility classes for common typography, appearance, layout, and state styles.
// These are designed to be scoped to distinct concerns in styling,
// such as the `font-size` and `font-family` of a common heading presentation,
// or the `width` and `margin` of a recurring container style.
// Utility classes are indicated by a prefix:
// * `t-` - typography
// * `a-` - appearance
// * `l-` - layout
// * `is-`/`has-` - state
